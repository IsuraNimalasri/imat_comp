## Details
Visual analysis of clothing is a topic that has received increasing attention in recent years. Being able to recognize apparel products and associated attributes from pictures could enhance shopping experience for consumers, and increase work efficiency for fashion professionals. 

We present a new clothing dataset with the goal of introducing a novel fine-grained segmentation task by joining forces between the fashion and computer vision communities. The proposed task unifies both categorization and segmentation of rich and complete apparel attributes, an important step toward real-world applications. While early work in computer vision addressed related clothing recognition tasks, these are not designed with fashion insiders’ needs in mind, possibly due to the research gap in fashion design and computer vision. To address this, we first propose a fashion taxonomy built by fashion experts, informed by product description from the internet. To capture the complex structure of fashion objects and ambiguity in descriptions obtained from crawling the web, our standardized taxonomy contains 48 apparel objects (28 main apparel items and 20 apparel parts), and 349 related fine-grained attributes. Secondly, a total of 50K clothing images in daily-life, celebrity events, and online shopping are labeled by both domain experts and crowd workers for fine-grained segmentation. 

In this competition, we challenge you to develop algorithms that will help with an important step towards automatic product detection – to accurately assign segmentations and attribute labels for fashion images. Individuals/Teams with top submissions will be invited to present their work live at the FGVC6 workshop.

## Differences from iMat Fashion 2018

Whereas iMat-Fashion-2018 covered fine-grained attributes classification, this year our competition introduces a novel task, which is to jointly learn apparel instance segmentation with fine-grained attributes classification. Our 2019 dataset also propose a fashion taxonomy built by fashion experts, with total 397 apparel categories and attributes.
